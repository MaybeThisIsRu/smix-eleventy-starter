I love Firefox, and I adore Mozilla as a company doing the right things for the health and longevity of an open web -- even when no one else seems to care.

However, I have long complained of its performance on desktop (to myself, or publicly) for a [number](https://fosstodon.org/web/statuses/104312278659407479) of [times](https://fosstodon.org/web/statuses/104631969365245588) now. Pages render so slowly, and the whole affair seems janky at the least. It's probably the Gecko engine at play here, and [WebRender should help](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/) matters.

At the moment however, I can say Blink feels really, really fast. I'm forced to prioritize my productivity for once.

Well, is two days enough for a judgement? Probably. I spend a lot of time on the web, so evaluating a browser in such a time-frame is acceptable to me.

## Likes

* After importing my bookmarks from Firefox, I was simply able to hit a `Get thumbnails` button to fetch thumbnails for all the bookmarks. Why isn't this a thing in every browser?
* The web felt fast again. It's nice knowing I can _just_ quickly open a page and close it and be on my way. With Firefox, I usually open a link, wait, wait... lose context (and patience), and then connect with the lost context again. Not fun.
* Customization. I really enjoyed having a proper menu bar at the top. I wish Firefox had this option.
* Absolutely adorable was the browser changing its accent based on the tab open. It made the web feel a little more fun and personal. 😀

* The way the visibility of hidden add-ons is handled! Click a toggle, and they pop up amongst the other permanently visible add-ons. No context loss. No searching in another menu.

## Dislikes

* I had to spend 5 minutes disabling a lot of fluff: the speed dial, Vivaldi icon as the menu button with a vertical dropdown menu (instead opting for a hamburger icon with a horizontal menu), a clock at the bottom right of the browser in the status bar, and so on. Nothing too bad. Vivaldi does offer a lot of toggles so thankfully I was not tied in to the default experience.
* Browser is unable to infer its theme from the system dark mode. [A known bug in the Chromium project](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=998903), but no telling how long this takes. Consequently, even websites which have added extra CSS for `prefers-color-scheme(dark)` do not work on Vivaldi. Linux users - stick with Firefox if dark mode is important to you.
* No DNS over HTTPS, and [a very confusing and high-horse response from the community](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/44672/dns-over-https-needs-to-be-implemented). Unfortunately, not everyone can or do trust their ISP for their DNS queries. The barrier to suggested alternatives is high enough for me to instead just use a VPN. I would expect an easy toggle - both Chrome and Firefox offer this.
* [BitWarden's auto-fill keyboard shortcut is broken](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/43370/bitwarden-autofill-shorcut-broken-on-newer-vivaldi). Even worse, BitWarden doesn't work on Vivaldi for Android, which is a huge no-go. Copying passwords to paste them in defeats the point of using a password manager. With so much clipboard "bugs" coming out in the open, this feels unsafe.
* The page zoom can be set per tab, but not per domain.

## Will I stick with Vivaldi?

Unfortunately, no. Non-existent dark mode support and BitWarden's auto-fill keyboard shortcut not working are clear deal breakers.

I've moved on to [Brave](https://brave.com/), something I had disqualified on account of their shenanigans in the recent past. While I dearly miss the dynamic accent color, I'm going to have to live without it. 😭
